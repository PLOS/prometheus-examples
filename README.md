# prometheus instrumentation examples

This repo contains python examples for implementing an online service
and an offline, batch-processing service.

The code samples are silly and contrived, and designed to quickly
demonstrate how prometheus instrumentation is implemented.

of this code in action, and the accompanying [slide deck](https://slides.com/wryfi/prometheus-instrumentation/).

PLOS developers working in other languages are welcome to add examples
for their language here, and to rearrange the repo as it makes sense
to accommodate other language examples!
